<h1>Machine Learning Recommendations</h1>
<h2>General</h2>
The combination of <a href="https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html">Probabilistic Machine Learning (Advanced Topics) by Kevin Murphy</a>
and <a href="https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html">Probabilistic Machine Learning (Introduction) by Kevin Murphy</a>
forms the only good modern textbook in the field, which is still too young to have a shorter summary. <a href="https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/">Understanding Deep Learning</a> contains some nice theoretical exercises and the style is immaculate. Certainly the prettiest ML textbook so far. <a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org">The Deep Learning Book</a> was the first good Deep Learning textbook, although you should read Murphy's now as it is clearer and more up to date.
<a href="https://colah.github.io">Colah's essays</a> bring nice blog-post style explanations and visualisations. However, the best visualizations are, as usual, given by 3B1B in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi">Neural Networks</a> series.

<h2>Calculus and Linear Algebra</h2>
These are by far the two most important branches of mathematics for scientists and engineers. Start with <a href="https://matrixeditions.com/5thUnifiedApproach.html">Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach</a>, my favourite mathematics textbooks. Even contains some analysis for the curious. Then you might wanna read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0387974876">Linear Algebra Done Right by Sheldon Axler</a> to get a little training in abstraction. If you are still hungy for abstraction, use <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/10702?srsltid=AfmBOoq6dq1OWkAdL9vVqMAKq1vRyK_Id632vCFWepbXYavL5msaoLft#t=aboutBook">Mathematical Analysis for Machine Learning</a> looks okay. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Multivariable-Calculus-Stewart-Calculus-7th/dp/9386422185">Multivariable Calculus by Stewart</a> is also a gold standard.

<h2>Probabilities</h2>
Start with <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Art-Probability-Richard-W-Hamming/dp/0201406861">The Art of Probability</a> by Richard Hamming. 
<a href=""https://www.inference.org.uk/itprnn/book.pdf>Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms</a> is by far the most interesting textbook on information theory.
<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~slacoste/teaching/ift6269/A24/">Simon Lacoste-Julien's Notes for IFT6269</a> given at MILA are great to understand both advanced probability theory and algorithms.

<h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
Start with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05265">Reinforcement Learning: An Overview</a> by Kevin Murphy or <a href="https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/">Spinning Up RL</a> from OpenAI. There is also <a href="https://pierrelucbacon.com/rlbook/intro.html">Pierre-Luc Bacon's Reinforcement Learning Book</a>, which is amazingly precise for some concepts. For the game theory in MARL I suggest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Game-Theory-Andrew-Tadelis/dp/0691168276">Introduction to Game Theory by Tadelis</a>.

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<a href="https://gist.github.com/matijagrcic/ae8353eb1e6be84a7c85d9fdc2f9631f">Ilya Sutskever's Reading List</a>
