<h1>Quest for 21st Century</h1>
Throughout history, humans have made catastrophes for populations because
1) their motivations were misaligned with said populations
2) they misunderstood their own likings
3) they used a wrong tool or strategy
As our techology improves exponenially, 3) is becoming less and less of an issue.
The damage that can be caused by a single individual
is a growing function with respect to techological development.
Then 1) and 2) must be adressed.
<br><br>
The neocortex is constantly trying to construct a model of the world.
One of the most important things it is trying to model is the system which gives it rewards.
But that system is irreducibly complicated. It is beyond anything which
can be described by a book.
<br><br>
Therefore, it is crucial that we do not give into the temptation
of maximizing simple metrics such as GDP, negative entropy, scientific progress, etc.
<br><br>
In general, it is easier to break something than to build it.
As the power of a single individual grows, the damage that they can inflict
will grow, because of the superiority of offense to defense at higher
orders of technological capability.
<br><br>
There is a solution. The most powerful tool we have must be tilted towards defense.
This is possible with AI.
<br><br>
However, we must remember not to underestimate problem 2).
The best use of AI is one were it only involves itself to prevent catastrophes.
By catastrophes, I mean anything that steers the whole human population into a sink state.
Any other trajectory that we try to engage in assumes a far too good understanding of our preferences.
