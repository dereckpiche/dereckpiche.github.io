    <h1>Where Are we Going? (in developpement) </h1>
    Civilization is developping faster than ever. 
    Then is it not obvious that we should ask if its going in the right direction?

    <h2>The Data</h2>
    Let us first analyze the recent curves on metrics which aim to be proxies for human wellness. 

    <h3>GDP per Capita</h3>
    GDP measures the total production of goods and services within a country. The simplest way to get this metric is to substract the value of what you created to the cost you paid for getting the ressources to create it. It is a measure of the total productivity of a nation. Obviously, this metric will often grow as you add  more people so you want to divide by population size.

    This metric has been on the rise since 1990:

    Most countries are getting more productive. 

    <h3>Physical Health</h3>
    Are people healthier? Let us look at life expectancy of each continents:

    (However, I suspect a confounding factor here is child mortality).
    But we have:

    We seem less healthy in the ways that do not kill us. In other words, our 
    habits are getting worst but our medical system is improving. 
    <br><br>


    <h3>The Climate</h3>
    <iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/temperature-anomaly?tab=chart" loading="lazy" allow="web-share; clipboard-write"></iframe>
    Quick explanation: earth's energy comes mostly from solar radiation. Before the industrial revolution, the atmosphere was mostly constant. Then the quantity of rays that bounced back from earth was also mostly constant which means that earth's temperature was mostly constant and thus all life evolved to fit it. But then our modern methods of production (and cows) emit what are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas">greenhouse cases</a> which go up in the atmosphere and stay there. The good thing is that these gazes absorb sun rays, but not strongly enough such that most can pass through. The bad thing is that they are strong enough to absorb a lot of them when they bounce back and hit the atmosphere layer for a second time. Thus, heat gets trapped and the earth is warming for life forms which will not have the time to evolve accordingly, at least biologically. 
    
    <h2>My Conclusion</h2>
    Humanities fast paced progress should mostly be attributed to scientists and inventors. Technology is driving most of the change. Indeed, I would hold that several of the most important social reforms finally happened because it became easy to communicate ideas rapidlly through printed texts. 
    <br>
    Technological progress is still the beating heart of change in our modern societies. Appart from climate change, every metric seems to be going in the right direction. It really looks like where generally going in the right direction.
