    <h1>Where Are we Going? (in developpement) </h1>
    Civilization is developping faster than ever. 
    Then is it not obvious that we should ask if its going in the right direction?

    <h2>The Data</h2>
    Let us first analyze the recent curves on metrics which aim to be proxies for human wellness. 
    <h3>GDP per Capita</h3>
    GDP measures the total production of goods and services within a country. The simplest way to get this metric is to substract the value of what you created to the cost you paid for getting the ressources to create it. It is a measure of the total productivity of a nation. Obviously, this metric will often grow as you add  more people so you want to divide by population size.

    This metric has been on the rise since 1990:

    Conclusion: most countries are getting more productive. 
    <h3>Physical Health</h3>
    Are people more healthy? Let us look at life expectancy of each continents:

    Maybe this is due to infant death. Let us look at deaths from cardiovascular diseases:

    Conclusion: We are indeed getting healthier.
