Some things are irreducibly complicated to a 
higher degree than the neocortex can bare. One of these is 
the own reward system it is trying to please. 
<br><br>
Yet, the stubborn among us come up with funny simplifications. 
For example: to maximize 
understanding of nature, to maximize one's role in the 
social hierarchy, to minimize suffering in the world, to 
minimize entropy (or equivalently to maximize free 
energy). These evidently do not translate accurately the 
richness of even a single person's needs, but the pursuit 
of these simple ideals lead to wonderful adventures 
which do satisfy their minds. 
<br><br>
Throughout history, humans have made catastrophes for populations because 
1) their motivations were misaligned with said populations
2) they misunderstood their own likings 
3) they used a wrong tool or strategy
As 3) is getting less and less of difficult to solve, 1) and 2) must be adressed.
We are lucky that the damage that can be caused by a single individual is 
still this limited.

As other techologies develop, the *intelligence* branch must focus on conservation.
This branch should not prevent intense experiences and change from our race,
but it should prevent any deviation which will prevent a return to an anchor.
We should then aim, as a collective, to 
maximize human-proximal variance in a sustainable 
manner.
