    <a class="essays-title" href="#">Nobel Prize Fiasco | October 9 2024</a>
    <div class="essays-content">
    Both the Physics and Chemistry Nobel Prizes were just awarded mostly to computer scientists.
    I think its time to create an official Nobel Prize for Computer Science.
    It has clearly become the most important technical field with the rise of Deep Learning.

    <a class="essays-title" href="#">Causality | September 29 2024</a>
    <div class="essays-content">
    <br><br>
    The fundamental root of human understanding is causality. If you understand something, its because you model a causal relation somewhere.
    <br><br>
    (Correlation is not causation but is <it>caused</it> by it. That two variables are correlated
    simply means that they are, somewhere in the causal graph,
    descendants of at least one common ancestor variable.)
    <br><br>
    But if causality is to be treated as a phenomenon, we could only understand it through our understanding apparatus, which relies on causality...  Here there is no mirror with which the eye can stare at itself.

    <a class="essays-title" href="#">A Quest for the 21st Century | July 23 2024</a>
    <div class="essays-content">
    Throughout history, humans have made catastrophes for populations because
    1) their motivations were misaligned with said populations
    2) they misunderstood their own likings
    3) they used a wrong tool or strategy
    As our techology improves exponenially, 3) is becoming less and less of an issue.
    The damage that can be caused by a single individual
    is a growing function with respect to techological development.
    Then 1) and 2) must be adressed.
    <br><br>
    The neocortex is constantly trying to construct a model of the world.
    One of the most important things it is trying to model is the system which gives it rewards.
    But that system is irreducibly complicated. It is beyond anything which
    can be described by a book.
    <br><br>
    Therefore, it is crucial that we do not give into the temptation
    of maximizing simple metrics such as GDP, negative entropy, scientific progress, etc.
    <br><br>
    In general, it is easier to break something than to build it.
    As the power of a single individual grows, the damage that they can inflict
    will grow, because of the superiority of offense to defense at higher
    orders of technological capability.
    <br><br>
    There is a solution. The most powerful tool we have must be tilted towards defense.
    This is possible with AI.
    <br><br>
    However, we must remember not to underestimate problem 2).
    The best use of AI is one were it only involves itself to prevent catastrophes.
    By catastrophes, I mean anything that steers the whole human population into a sink state.
    Any other trajectory that we try to engage in assumes a far too good understanding of our preferences.
