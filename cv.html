                        My specialized bachelor’s degree provides me with a lot
                        of freedom in the choice of courses. As a result of my
                        interests, it is, compared to the typical computer
                        science bachelor, significantly more inclined towards
                        applied mathematics and machine learning.

                        Utero is a work-in-progress library for adaptive
                        algorithms written in Julia. It builds on no outside
                        dependencies and contains its own auto-differentiation
                        engine.
