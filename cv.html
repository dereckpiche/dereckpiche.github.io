Honors Bachelor's in Computer Science, University of
Montreal
</h4>
<p>
2021 - December 2023<br />
UdeM's Computer Science bachelor has a theoretical/mathy reputation. Took the honor path to learn more applied mathematics (in the US this would probably be equivalent to a minor in maths) and initiate myself to research / graduate classes early. Did research with Guillaume Rabusseau on Tensor Network Compositions.

<h2>Projects and Achievements</h2>
<div class="projects">
<h4>Utero</h4>
<p>
December 2023 - Today<br />
Utero is a work-in-progress library for adaptive
algorithms written in Julia. It builds on no outside
dependencies and contains its own auto-differentiation
engine.

<h4>Tensor Network Compositions</h4>
<p>
2023<br />
Research on the use of tensor network methods for
machine learning with Professor Guillaume Rabusseau,
which is a core academic member of MILA.

</p>
<h4>MNIST Sum Competition</h4>
<p>
2022<br />
Finished in the first position among bachelor’s students
in a Kaggle competition for classifying sums of pairs of
handwritten digits using data augmentation and an
ensemble of convolutional neural networks.
</p>
<h4>Minimalist Chess Engine</h4>
<p>
2021<br />
Programmed a minimalist chess engine using the MinMax
algorithm (with α-β pruning).

<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<div class="experience">
<h4>DIRO University Tutor</h4>
<p>
January 2024 - Today<br />
Employed by the department of computer science and
operations research of the University of Montreal to
help bachelor students in all their classes.
</p>
<h4>Deep Learning Engineer, GPR Geophysics, Longueuil</h4>
<p>
May 2023 - August 2023<br />
Internship where I worked on a large-scale deep learning
geophysics project. I also did computer graphics to
contribute to the creation of synthetic data.
</p>
<h4>Instructor, Combat Sports, Montreal</h4>
<p>
2022 - March 2023<br />
Greatly improved my social skills.
</p>
<h4>Provisioner Assistant and Others, Fidélise, Gatineau</h4>
<p>
September 2017 - March 2021<br />
Working at Fidélise improved my teamwork capability and
organizational skills, as I had to collaborate with my
colleagues and perform various tasks in a short amount
of time as a delivery person, dishwasher, and assistant
provisioner.
